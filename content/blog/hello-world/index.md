This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on [salted duck eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> **Stockholm syndrome** has been defined as a condition in which hostages develop a psychological alliance with their captors during captivity.[\[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome#cite_note-1) Emotional bonds may be formed between captor and captives, during intimate time together, but these are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims. Stockholm syndrome has never been included in the [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders") or DSM, the standard tool for diagnostic of psychiatric illnesses and disorders, mainly due to the lack of a consistent body of academic research.[\[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome#cite_note-Adorjan_2012-2)[\[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome#cite_note-:0-3)[\[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome#cite_note-DSM-5-4) The syndrome is extremely rare as noted by the US [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation "Federal Bureau of Investigation")'s Hostage Barricade Database System and *[Law Enforcement Bulletin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI_Law_Enforcement_Bulletin "FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin")* estimating that fewer than 5% of kidnapping victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.[\[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome#cite_note-FBI-1999-5)
